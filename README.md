# Smart-Farm
Smart farming is a management concept focused on providing the agricultural industry with the infrastructure to leverage advanced technology – including big data, the cloud and the internet of things (IoT) – for tracking, monitoring, automating and analyzing operations. Also known as precision agriculture, smart farming is software-managed and sensor-monitored. Smart farming is growing in importance due to the combination of the expanding global population, the increasing demand for higher crop yield, the need to use natural resources efficiently, the rising use and sophistication of information and communication technology and the increasing need for climate-smart agriculture:the solution that i used in this project include the most important of smart farming technologie sush as :
-Sensors for soil scanning and water, light, humidity and temperature management.
-Smart irrigation system
-remote herd supervision using a camera and web page
-Monitor the temperature of the milk container
-others options
